# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository **alx-project-0x02-setup** provides the initial scaffolding for a modern web application using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It is designed as a foundational setup to help developers quickly spin up projects with clean structure, type safety, and responsive styling.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this repository is to establish a baseline project environment that demonstrates:

- Scaffold a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Enable ESLint for code quality enforcement.
- Create a modular folder structure for components, interfaces, and assets.
- Add a simple welcome message to verify the setup.

## 📦 Features

- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer productivity.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design.
- **ESLint + Prettier** for consistent code quality and formatting.
